# IDE-CSharp package

Updated C# language support for Atom-IDE, powered by the [Omnisharp Language Server](https://github.com/OmniSharp/csharp-language-server-protocol).

## Early access

This is a fork of the original [IDE-CSharp](https://github.com/atom/atom-languageclient) in an attempt to update it to the maintained (experimental) Omnisharp Language Server and get as much working as possible.  I'm no expert on this stuff, so any help would be welcome.

## Features

We'll see once I get it working!

* ~~Auto completion~~
* ~~Code format~~
* ~~Diagnostics (errors & warnings)~~
* ~~Document outline~~
* ~~Find references~~
* ~~Go to definition~~
* ~~Hover~~
* ~~Reference highlighting~~
